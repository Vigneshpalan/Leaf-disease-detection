## Introduction

In this project, we develop a leaf disease detection system using deep learning. We use a CNN model to classify leaf images into healthy or diseased categories. The system aims to help farmers and agricultural experts detect diseases in their crops at an early stage, enabling them to take timely measures for disease management.

## Dataset

We collected a diverse dataset of leaf images, which includes both healthy leaves and leaves affected by various diseases. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the performance of the CNN model. The images were preprocessed by resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.

## Model Architecture

We designed a CNN architecture for leaf disease detection. The model consists of several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The architecture is implemented using TensorFlow/PyTorch (choose one) deep learning framework.
